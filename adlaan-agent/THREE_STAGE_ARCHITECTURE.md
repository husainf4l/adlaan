# ✅ Three-Stage Agent Architecture Complete!

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Your legal agent now uses an advanced **three-stage processing pipeline**:

```
User Request → [Thinking] → [Planning] → [Execution] → Response
```

Each stage runs sequentially, building upon the previous stage's output.

---

## 🧠 Stage 1: Thinking Node

**Purpose:** Analyze and understand the user's request

**Location:** `agent/nodes/thinking_node.py`

**What it does:**
- Analyzes the user's legal request in detail
- Classifies the task type:
  - `DOCUMENT_CREATION` - Drafting legal documents
  - `CONSULTATION` - Legal advice/questions
  - `DOCUMENT_REVIEW` - Reviewing/analyzing documents
  - `RESEARCH` - Legal research needs
- Determines complexity level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Identifies key requirements
- Suggests the best approach

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "thinking_analysis": {
    "thinking": "Detailed analysis of the request",
    "task_type": "DOCUMENT_CREATION",
    "complexity": "MEDIUM",
    "key_requirements": ["requirement1", "requirement2"],
    "suggested_approach": "How to handle this"
  }
}
```

**Temperature:** 0.3 (focused, analytical thinking)

---

## 📋 Stage 2: Planning Node

**Purpose:** Create a detailed execution plan

**Location:** `agent/nodes/planning_node.py`

**What it does:**
- Takes the thinking analysis as input
- Creates a step-by-step execution plan
- Identifies required sections/components
- Lists legal considerations
- Defines the output format

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "execution_plan": {
    "plan_summary": "Overview of the plan",
    "steps": [
      {"step": 1, "action": "What to do", "output": "What this produces"},
      {"step": 2, "action": "...", "output": "..."}
    ],
    "required_sections": ["section1", "section2"],
    "legal_considerations": ["consideration1", "consideration2"],
    "output_format": "How to structure the response"
  }
}
```

**Temperature:** 0.4 (creative yet structured planning)

---

## ⚖️ Stage 3: Execution Node

**Purpose:** Generate the final legal response

**Location:** `agent/nodes/legal_agent.py`

**What it does:**
- Executes the plan from Stage 2
- Generates the actual legal content
- Creates messages and documents
- Formats everything properly

**Output Structure:**
```json
[
  {"type": "message", "content": "Explanation text"},
  {"type": "doc", "content": "LEGAL DOCUMENT\n\nFull content..."}
]
```

**Temperature:** 0.7 (creative, comprehensive output)

---

## 🔄 How It Works Together

### Example Flow: "Draft a simple NDA"

**Stage 1: Thinking** 🧠
```
Input: "Draft a simple non-disclosure agreement"

Analysis:
- Task Type: DOCUMENT_CREATION
- Complexity: MEDIUM
- Requirements: ["NDA structure", "Standard clauses", "Template format"]
- Approach: "Create a comprehensive yet simple NDA template"
```

**Stage 2: Planning** 📋
```
Plan:
- Step 1: Identify essential NDA clauses
- Step 2: Structure the document
- Step 3: Add standard legal language
- Step 4: Include placeholders for customization

Required Sections:
- Definitions
- Confidentiality obligations
- Term and termination
- Governing law
```

**Stage 3: Execution** ⚖️
```
Output:
[
  {
    "type": "message",
    "content": "Below is a simple NDA template..."
  },
  {
    "type": "doc",
    "content": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n\nThis Agreement..."
  }
]
```

## 🌊 Streaming Behavior

All three stages **stream tokens in real-time**:

- **Thinking tokens:** Stream as the agent analyzes
- **Planning tokens:** Stream as the plan is created
- **Execution tokens:** Stream as the final response is generated

**Total token count in test:** 2,805 tokens across all three stages!

**Advantages:**
- ✅ User sees progress immediately
- ✅ No waiting for complete response
- ✅ More transparent decision-making
- ✅ Better user experience

---

## 💾 State Management

The agent maintains state across all stages:

```python
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: List[BaseMessage]          # Conversation history
    thinking_analysis: Optional[Dict]    # Output from Stage 1
    execution_plan: Optional[Dict]       # Output from Stage 2
    structured_response: List[Dict]      # Final output from Stage 3
```

**With PostgreSQL Checkpointing:**
- All state is persisted after each stage
- Conversations can be resumed
- Full context maintained across sessions

---

## 📊 Graph Structure

```
START
  ↓
[Thinking Node]
  ↓ (thinking_analysis)
[Planning Node]
  ↓ (execution_plan)
[Execution Node]
  ↓ (structured_response)
END
```

**Sequential processing** ensures:
- Each stage builds on previous results
- Logical, structured approach
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to debug and optimize

---

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Model Selection
Each node can use different models:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Used for all stages
    use_checkpointing=True        # Enable conversation memory
)
```

### Temperature Settings
- **Thinking:** 0.3 (analytical)
- **Planning:** 0.4 (structured creativity)
- **Execution:** 0.7 (full creativity)

### Checkpointing
- Enable: Full conversation persistence
- Disable: Faster, stateless operation

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Test file:** `test_three_stage.py`

**Run test:**
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_three_stage.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ All three stages execute
- ✅ Token-level streaming works
- ✅ Response structure is correct
- ✅ Performance metrics

**Test results:**
- Stages: All 3 stages completed ✓
- Tokens: 2,805 streamed ✓
- Characters: 14,377 ✓
- Streaming: Real-time ✓

## 🚀 Using the Three-Stage Agent

### In FastAPI endpoint:

```python
# main.py already updated to use the new agent!

async for token in agent.astream(message, thread_id=thread_id):
    # Streams tokens from ALL three stages
    yield token
```

### In your code:

```python
from agent.agent import Agent

# Initialize
agent = Agent(use_checkpointing=True)

# Stream response
async for token in agent.astream("Draft a contract"):
    print(token, end='', flush=True)
```

### Debug interface:

Visit `http://localhost:8005/debug` - it now streams all three stages!

---

## 📈 Performance Comparison

### Before (Single Stage):
```
User → [Agent] → Response
- Simple, fast
- No intermediate analysis
- Direct execution
```

### After (Three Stages):
```
User → [Think] → [Plan] → [Execute] → Response
- Thoughtful analysis
- Structured planning
- High-quality execution
- More tokens, but better quality
```

**Trade-off:** ~2-3x more tokens, but significantly better quality and reasoning!
